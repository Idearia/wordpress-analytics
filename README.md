## DESCRIPTION
Install *WordPress Analytics* on your website to track user activity beyond simple pageviews, and to allow efficient communication between WordPress and Google Analytics.

So far *WordPress Analytics* supports the following features:

* **Scroll tracking**: track the scrolling actions performed by users; this is an improved version of Justin Cutroni's [content tracking script].
* **Content grouping**: send category information from WordPress to Google Analytics, with WooCommerce support.
* **Call tracking**: track clicks on phone numbers throughout the website, with the possibility to include/exclude certain numbers based on regex.
* **Email tracking**: track clicks on email addresses throughout the website.
* **Form tracking**: track form submissions made via [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/).


The next feature to be implemented will be:

* **Custom-fields support**: send any kind of information from WordPress to Google Analytics using custom fields & taxonomies, with support to the industry standard plugin [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).


## INSTALL
